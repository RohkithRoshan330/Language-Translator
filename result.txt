GENERATED OUTPUT FROM MARIANMT - According to an analysis by OpenAI in 2018: "Since 2012, the amount of calculation used in the largest trainings of AI has increased exponentially with a doubling time of 3.4 months (in comparison, Moore's law had a doubling period of 2 years). Since 2012, this metric9 has increased by more than 300,000 times (a doubling period of 2 years would only give a 7-fold increase). "10. This increase in computing power facilitated the emergence of generative AI that could create original things such as images, paintings, music or text, drawing on existing data without copying them. They do not simply classify the input data provided to them, nor predict statistically probable data; they generate new content whose databases are only partly similar to the learning databases they have been provided11. The public versions of large generic AI models available in 2022 and 2023 produce modulated and filtered content so as to limit their bias, misleading, dangerous, racist, biased, shocking, hateful, unsolicited, pornographic or sexually explicit images12,13,14,15. In the early 2020s, the computing power of the AIA doubled every six to ten months, allowing the AIA models to progress at an exponential rate. Anglophones speak of "Border AI" to designate AI models with the highest and most general capabilities, and which could present new risks16. This type of AI was made known to the public by ChatGPT (and its variant Bing Chat), a chatbot (programmable conversational agent) designed by OpenAI from its major GPT-3 and GPT-417 foundation language models, as well as by Bard, a Google chatbot based on LaMDA. Other generic AI models include artificial intelligence artistic systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and DALL-E18. These AIs have a very wide spectrum of potential applications in creative fields (plastic arts, cinema, music, writing, design, weather, architecture, etc.), but also in the health, finance, video games and simulators sectors, in all fields of science and technology, social sciences, industry and knowledge. They have recently led to a leap forward in molecular biology and understanding complex physical phenomena. They make it possible to synthesize realistic human faces and voices. They offer new ways of exploring hypotheses and scenarios (notably recently through the production of sophisticated synthetic data from the field of IA-assisted generative research)[ref. necessary]...
